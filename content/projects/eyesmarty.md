# EyeSmarty

## Experience with EyeSmarty

For a year and a half, I was involved with Eyesmarty, initially as a team member and later as the manager of its web application segment. I collaborated closely with the manager to grasp project requirements and then delegated tasks to team members accordingly. Additionally, I worked closely with the designer and was primarily responsible for developing the web interface and its functionalities.

## Technologies Used

Vue.js, Vuex, React.js, Redux, Socket.io, WebRTC, Node, electron, PWA, HTML, CSS

## Key achievements while working on EyeSmarty

As part of the front-end team, my responsibilities included writing HTML/CSS and JavaScript code based on Figma designs, integrating third-party services and APIs into projects, ensuring validation of all user input before submission to back-end services, and addressing bugs, updates, and maintenance tasks for existing projects while collaborating closely with team members and stakeholders.
