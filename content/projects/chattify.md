# Chattify

## Experience with Chattify

In my spare time, I developed a chat application that supports both individual and group conversations. It includes essential features such as one-on-one messaging and group creation, with real-time communication and notification support. For example, if you're chatting with another user and receive messages from others, you'll be notified. I plan to incorporate audio and video call functionality in the near future.

## Technologies Used

React.js, Context API, Chakra UI, Socket.io, Node, Express, MongoDB

## Key achievements while working on EyeSmarty

I've explored a few exciting technologies like Node, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.io for real-time communication. Planning to integrate audio/video calling functionality soon!.
